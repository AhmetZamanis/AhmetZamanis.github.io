### Deep learning imbalanced classification - Used cars "kicks" problem
[Link to report](https://github.com/AhmetZamanis/UsedCarKicksClassification/blob/main/Report.md), [Link to GitHub repository](https://github.com/AhmetZamanis/UsedCarKicksClassification)
Imbalanced binary classification with scikit-learn and PyTorch Lightning, on a large dataset of used cars. Comparing logistic regression, SVM and XGBoost trained with class weights, with a neural network trained with focal loss. Performing hyperparameter optimization with Optuna. Assessing model performances with classification metrics & a sensitivity analysis based on a business scenario.
